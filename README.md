# Viavoc - Voice Code Editor

Android code editor that allowed to write Java code using your speech only.

It had a built in potential to run Java code within Android since code editor represents almost complete Java wrapper.

Removed from the Google Play after ChatGPT release, due to uselessness. Project 2018-2019.
