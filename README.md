# Viavoc - Voice Code Editor

First Android code editor on Google Play that allowed to write Java code using your speech only.

It had a built-in potential to run Java code within Android since code editor represents almost complete Java wrapper.

It was removed from the Google Play after ChatGPT release, due to needlessness. Project 2018-2019.

Feel free to use it for any purpose as you wish.

Here are some screenshots of the app:
